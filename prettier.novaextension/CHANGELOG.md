## 3.5.16 - 2025-04-13

### Added

- New Command: **Format Document (Forced)** â€” formats the current file even if its
  syntax is ignored or excluded via `.prettierignore`.

### Changed

- Dismissing the warning shown when using _Format Selection_ on unsupported syntaxes
  now disables the command for those syntaxes.
- Refined user-facing notifications for unsupported syntaxes and reset actions
- Internal: Refactored plugin and Prettier options handling

## 3.5.15 - 2025-04-12

### Added

- **Automatic package and patch management**

  - Implemented a module resolver to validate all dependencies declared in `package.json`
  - Automatically runs `npm install` for any missing or outdated packages
  - Applies patches using `patch-package` after every install
  - Ensures patches are reapplied even when no packages are updated

- **Syntax restriction for "Format Selection"**
  - Limited "Format Selection" to syntaxes supported by Prettierâ€™s `formatWithCursor`:
    JavaScript, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Handlebars
  - This restriction is due to upstream limitations in Prettier's cursor handling logic
  - Displays a dismissible warning when attempting to format unsupported syntaxes
  - Added command: **Reset Syntax Warnings for Prettier+** to restore suppressed messages

### Fixed

- **Prevent crash in `locStart` / `locEnd`**
  - Added null-safe checks and fallback handling to avoid crashes when a node lacks location data
  - This issue occurred in the XML plugin and previously prevented XML files from being formatted
  - Prevents `formatWithCursor` from throwing TypeErrors on malformed AST nodes

## 3.5.14 - 2025-04-09

> Note: This version supersedes 3.5.13, which was briefly published and then withdrawn due to a forgotten code update.

### Changed

- Switched to Prettierâ€™s native `formatWithCursor` for cursor preservation during formatting.
- Removed the custom diff-based cursor logic and `fast-diff` dependency.
- Cursor handling is now handled by Prettier directly, making the code simpler and more reliable.
- Editor now automatically scrolls to the restored cursor position after formatting.

### Performance

- Formatting is now **dramatically faster**.
- A 49,395-character JSON file that previously took **30 seconds** to format now completes in just **20 milliseconds**.

## 3.5.12 - 2025-04-09

### Fixed

- Corrected option handling for `node-sql-parser`: the extension previously used the wrong configuration key,
  which caused it to parse options for `sql-formatter` instead.

## 3.5.11 - 2025-04-08

### Added

- Full German translation of the UI

### Changed

- Removed the config key `prettier.plugins.prettier-plugin-php.singleQuote`
  (it duplicated `prettier.default-config.singleQuote`)
- Cleaned up descriptions for several options
- Database language names now follow official spelling

All UI elements have been translated into German. If you spot anything awkward or off,
head over to [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/prettier-for-nova/) and suggest improvements.

Chinese, French, and Japanese translations still need contributors â€” feel free to jump in! ðŸ˜„

## 3.5.10 - 2025-04-06

### Added

- Added support for formatting Java and `.properties` files
- Included `prettier-plugin-java` for Java source formatting
- Included `prettier-plugin-properties` for Java-style `.properties` configuration files

See the README for usage details.

## 3.5.9 - 2025-04-05

### Changed

- `workspaceConfig` keys now use boolean values instead of enums:
  - `Enable` â†’ `true`
  - `Disable` â†’ `false`
  - `Global Default` â†’ key removed to fall back to global settings
- Compatibility with the original enum-based behavior is preserved
- Extension permission for filesystem access has been updated from `readonly` to `readwrite` to enable migration of project configuration files

### Added

- Existing project configs (`.nova/Configuration.json`) are now automatically migrated to the new boolean format on startup
- A notification is shown if any project config values were changed during migration

## 3.5.8 - 2025-04-03

### Changed

- Updated README and LICENSE

## 3.5.7 - 2025-04-02

### Changed

- Restores the internal enum keys (`Enable`, `Disable`, `Global Default`) while keeping the original
  workspace config UI label values (`Enabled`, `Disabled`, `Global Setting`).
  This ensures compatibility with the original extension, allowing Prettier+ to be used as a drop-in replacement.
  _Note: If you previously used custom values in your workspace config, you may need to update them manually._

## 3.5.6 - 2025-04-02

### Added

- activationEvents: Prettier+ now uses conditional activation. It wonâ€™t run
  unless it finds a supported config file (like `.prettierrc`) in the project
  root.
- Localization groundwork: Initial translation support has been implemented.
  Translations can be contributed via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/prettier-for-nova/)

### Fixed

- Plugin option mapping: NGINX and SQL plugin options (specifically for node-sql-parser)
  were being mishandledâ€”this has now been corrected.

## 3.5.5 - 2025-04-01

### Added

- added new Prettier option: `objectWrap`

### Changed

- build: generate config from unified source

## 3.5.4 - 2025-04-01
